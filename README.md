This project is a competition with NASA, and our challenge title was "A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI." In this challenge, our goal was to build a complete AI-based product to classify planets as "habitable," "false," or "habitable." For this project, we relied on a comprehensive analysis and data cleaning of three complex data sets collected by the K2 and Kepler telescopes, as well as archived Kepler data, to prepare them for inclusion in the model. We used the TapNet algorithm, a powerful AI algorithm, and evaluated the overall performance of the model based on the Recall metric for the "habitable" category.
